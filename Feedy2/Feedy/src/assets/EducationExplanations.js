const carbD = `Carbohydrates are organic compounds made up of carbon, hydrogen,
              and oxygen atoms. They're one of the main types of nutrients and
              the most important source of energy for the body. When you consume
              carbohydrates, your body breaks them down into glucose, which is
              used for energy. There are two types of carbs: simple (sugars) and
              complex (starches and fiber). Complex carbs provide a slower
              release of energy and are found in foods like whole grains and
              vegetables. Simple carbs, found in fruits and sugary snacks, give
              a quick energy boost. Carbs also play a role in maintaining
              healthy brain function and gut health. arbohydrates (or carbs) are
              like your body's main fuel. When you eat foods like bread, pasta,
              and fruits, your body turns them into glucose, which gives you
              energy to run, play, and think. There are two types of carbs:
              simple carbs (like sugar) that give you quick energy, and complex
              carbs (like whole grains) that give you lasting energy.`;

const protD = `Proteins are large, complex molecules made up of smaller units
              called amino acids. They play a variety of roles in the body.
              Structurally, they provide support to cells and tissues.
              Functionally, they act as enzymes to speed up chemical reactions,
              transport molecules like oxygen through the blood, and help with
              immune responses by identifying and neutralizing foreign invaders.
              Basically, proteins are essential for the body's growth, repair,
              and overall function. They're like the workhorses of the body,
              handling numerous crucial tasks!Think of proteins like tiny
              machines that do all sorts of important jobs in your body. They
              help build and repair muscles, make enzymes (which speed up
              chemical reactions), fight off germs as part of your immune
              system, and even carry oxygen in your blood. So basically,
              proteins keep your body running smoothly and make sure everything
              works the way it should.`;

const fatD = `Fats, or lipids, are another crucial nutrient. They are made up of
              fatty acids and glycerol. Fats are essential for storing energy,
              insulating the body to maintain temperature, protecting vital
              organs, and aiding in the absorption of vitamins like A, D, E, and
              K. There are different types of fats, including saturated and
              unsaturated fats. Saturated fats, found in animal products and
              some processed foods, should be consumed in moderation, while
              unsaturated fats, found in fish, nuts, and olive oil, are
              healthier options. Fats are also important for building cell
              membranes and producing hormones.Fats are like the body's backup
              power and insulation. They help keep you warm, protect your
              organs, and help your body absorb certain vitamins. There are good
              fats (like the ones in fish and nuts) and not-so-good fats (like
              in fast food and sweets). Just make sure to have more of the good
              ones for a healthier body!`;

const calD = `A calorie is a way to measure energy. 
              It's like the fuel your body uses to do everything from 
              playing to thinking! When you eat food, your body gets calories from it, 
              which gives you the energy to move, grow, and stay healthy. If you eat more
              calories than your body needs, it stores the extra as fat. If you donâ€™t get 
              enough, your body uses up its energy stores to keep you going. So, calories 
              help your body stay powered up, just like gas in a car!`;

              in the overall diet.This means the most important aspect is the calories and the less
              is the supplements that we take. `;
