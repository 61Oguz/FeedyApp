const how2 = `To find out how much of each type of food (called macronutrients) we need, we can use guidelines that suggest percentages for each kind. Usually, our daily calories are divided into carbohydrates (about 45-65%), proteins (10-35%), and fats (20-35%). This helps our body get enough of each nutrient.

const how3 = `Our body uses calories as fuel, just like a car uses gas. The macronutrients (carbohydrates, proteins, and fats) provide these calories, each having its own job:

Carbohydrates give us energy, especially for activities like running or playing.
Proteins help build muscles, repair skin, and keep our body strong.
Fats help store energy and keep our body warm.

const how4 = `Each macronutrient has a specific number of calories per gram:

Carbohydrates and Proteins each have 4 calories per gram.
Fats have 9 calories per gram. By knowing how much of each macronutrient we eat, we can calculate our total calorie intake.

const how5 = `Healthy portions depend on our age, size, and activity level. Portion sizes help us eat the right amount of food for our body. One way to check portions is by using our hands or plates to measure:

Fist for veggies,
Palm for protein,
Thumb for fats, and
Cupped hand for carbs.

const how6 = `When eating out or picking snacks, try to choose foods that have less sugar, fat, and salt. Foods like fruit, yogurt, and nuts are better choices than candy or chips. Look for options that are baked, grilled, or steamed rather than fried.
